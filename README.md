# MyWorks4
Personal Code:In this project, I tested whether the word received from the user is a reflection word (madam,radar...). I used 4 classes while doing this process. These are the node, StackList, StackList and polyndromeTester(main) classes. Here's how the code works: First of all, I put each syllable of the word I received from the user into a Double linked list and stack. After that, I compared letters by reading from the beginning of the double list and popping the element in the stack at the same time. I accepted it as true if not false if letters don't match.
